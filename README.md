Assuptions

1. Tax is calculated per line and rounding is applied per line (so after multiplication per quantity)


Given more time to work on this project there are several obviouse improvements I would make:
1. Control with keyboard, buttons and checkboxes should be triggered by pressing enter.
2. Allowed formatting should be better. e.g. allow price with no decimal place.
3. Needs a unit test suite built.
4. Should have more comments.
5. The formatting of the receipt should be better with consistant tabbing and truncating overly long names
6. The Transaction class should be broken up into more methods e.g. have a method for finding tax rather than just doing it all in one loop to make the project more extendable.
